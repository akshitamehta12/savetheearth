<H3>MISSION</H3>

<P>Founded in 1972, the current objectives of Save The Earth Foundation are to provide factual educational information to the public about environmental awareness, while helping to fund a variety of environmental initiatives as a non-profit public benefit corporation. We currently aim to fund the single most impacting environmental changes worldwide in order to actively implement change. The overall objective of Save the Earth Foundation is to enhance the quality of our global environment for the benefit of all people while promoting a better understanding of the effects our society has on the long-term health of our planet.

<H3>GET INVOLVED</H3>
<P>Corporations getting involved with Save The Earth can actively create change by helping to fund some of the most important impacting global environmental initiatives. Manufacturers of earth friendly products can continue to join the team by becoming licensees, using our Save The Earth logo and hang tags on their products. The Save the Earth hang tag lets their customers know that part of the sales go to Save The Earth Foundation. The Save The Earth movement started in 1972. Over a decade later, Save the Earth Foundation was created to continue putting the message out – Save the Earth.

<H4>SAVE THE EARTH FOUNDATION HAS DONE SO MANY PROJECTS:</H4>
<P>Save the Earth Foundation is committed to raising public environmental consciousness, as well as actively implementing change. Previously, the foundation funding has helped to support a variety of scientific environmental research projects, as well as educational programs in some of the most prominent institutions of higher education. Not only do we continue to fund various NOAA projects, but our generous donations have made it possible to fund the Climate Center at Columbia University, which analyses and evaluates the current state of our atmosphere. Similarly, our grants have helped build UCLA’s Center for the Study of the Environment and Society, which focuses on the interactions between the environmental and social processes. We are proud to have funded the Phytotron Project at Duke University, which analyzes the consequences of global warming through large-scale modeling. Thanks to these climate centers and programs, we currently have much more access to environmental scientific discoveries. 

With the support of people worldwide from all walks of life, we are confident that the Foundation’s efforts will help to reverse the environmental deterioration of our planet.
